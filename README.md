# Overview

The goal is to be a funcitoning planner app. The first goal is to have two functioning pages: One for the outline of the day and another for adding events into the day.

I have been somewhat disatisfied by a lot of planner apps that exist. I want to create one that is to my liking while increasing my skills as a programmer.
